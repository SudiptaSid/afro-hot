						<h1>Etiquette</h1>
						<p>
							When contacting an escort, it is a good idea to provide some information about you. A polite introduction is very helpful as part of getting through any decent screening process from a quality escort.
						</p>
						<p>
							Be polite and respectful at all times; in person, on the phone and in emails. The only exception to this can be if you have agreed in advance with an escort a scenario where you want to play a specific role.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>Is it free?</h1>
						<p>
							Yes, it is always free to have a profile. There is a (generous) limit on the number of enquiries (messages and clicks on your phone number) you can get
							each
							month in 'free mode'.
							If you reach this limit we will send you an email and you will not appear for 14 days when people make a search, although you profile will continue to
							be
							live and people will still
							be able contact you. We do this to provide the fairest distribution of exposure on the site between our free members.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>How do I make a great profile?</h1>
						<p>
							If you provide a complete profile with accurate information, you will increase the number and quality of the results you get from it.
						</p>
						<ul class="disk-list">
							<li>Put real photos, preferably more than one</li>
							<li>Take time to provide a good description</li>
							<li>List only the services you provide</li>
							<li>Make sure your phone number is correct</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Please don't!</p>
						<ul class="disk-list">
							<li>
								Make more than one profile per individual (in the same city), they may be deleted. If you list as an agency and do make a profile for each girl this
								is
								permitted if you have their
								permission.
							</li>
							<li>Post fake listings or fake photos</li>
							<li>List only the services you provide</li>
							<li>Use ALL CAPS, it looks CHEAP</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>Can one individual have more than one profile?</h1>
						<p>
							No. If you create duplicate profiles they may be deleted or your account blocked. As an individual you can list in more than one city if you really are
							there often (please pause
							your listing when not there and put available dates on your different profiles). You will save time on responding to enquiries which don't produce
							business.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>Can I make profiles for different individuals?</h1>
						<p>
							Yes, as long as you have their permission for you to list them and they are real people.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>Can I see how much business you are generating for me?</h1>
						<p>
							We hope so! In your account area on Massage Republic you can see graphs which detail: the number of messages sent to you, clicks on your phone number
							and clicks through to your
							website. If you use Google Analytics you can also find the number of website visitors by looking in <b>Acquisition > Campaigns > All Campaigns</b>. We
							know you
							won't always know about all
							the customers we send, but we have tried our best to give you an idea! If you have questions about measurement, get in touch, as we really appreciate
							hearing about your results.

						<h1>What are the different options for my profile?</h1>
						<p>
							A few cities have higher pricing than the base prices below because of higher demand and better results for advertisers. You will see the price for your
							city from your listing
							page. Our main goal is to deliver value-for-money to everyone, based on results, while maintaining a free option for everyone.
						</p>
						<ul class="disk-list">
							<li>
								<b>VIP:</b> You get top priority in the search results and city main pages. Unlimited enquiries. <b>From €29/month</b>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Featured:</b> You appear ahead of Basic and Free profiles. Unlimited enquiries. <b>From €18/month</b>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Basic:</b> You get unlimited monthly enquires and priority over free members in the search results. <b>From €7/month</b>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Free:</b> You will appear after paid listings in the search results and if you receive over a certain amount of enquiries during a 30 day period
								your profile will be limited until the
								end of the period. We do this to provide for the fairest distribution of leads between our free members.

						<h1>I have problems paying?</h1>
						<p>
							If your card is not accepted, you will see an error message. There are several things you can try:
						</p>
						<ul class="disk-list">
							<li>
								Ensure your card has sufficient free funds on it
							</li>
							<li>
								Check with your bank that your card can make international payments online
							</li>
							<li>
								Check your card is enrolled with a secure online payment scheme such as 3D (Verfied by Visa) or Mastercard SecureCode - you should be able to do
								this online with your bank
							</li>
							<li>
								Call your bank to ask why the payment to Massage Republic for the amount you tried to pay was refused
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							If you have completed these steps please and still have a problem <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with details of what the problem is, including
							the error message.

				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>How are profiles ordered?</h1>
						<p>
							Profiles within the different categories (VIP, Featured, Basic and Free) are randomised daily and customised to the individual user and quality factors
							for each search (make sure
							you answer or ignore questions, add video and get reviews for the best results). We do this to provide the best possible experience for users and ensure
							that all advertisers in a
							single category receive a similar amount of exposure to users.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>How do you set prices?</h1>
						<p>
							Our main objective is to provide value-for-money. Our pricing is defined on a per city basis. We only raise prices (and not often) when the number of
							enquiries and advertisers goes
							over a certain level. This is to maintain the number of VIP and Featured listings at a level where each paid listing will continue to receive the number
							of enquiries they expect
							from us. We introduced variable pricing after talking to many advertisers who were asking how they could get more exposure and indicated they were
							willing to pay more if they could
							stand out.

				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>Fake photos are not OK</h1>
						<p>
							If you post fake photos, your account will be blocked. Also we will block other accounts you have. No excuses, no discussion. If you have a paid listing
							and it gets blocked the
							credits are not refundable.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>Why are my photos marked as fake?</h1>
						<p>
							This is the most common complaint from users about listings. In addition, fake photos are not fair for other advertisers. Your photos may be marked as
							fake because of a user
							report. You will receive a warning mail when this happens and then you have 48 hours to verify your photos before your listing gets blocked.
							Verification is free and you can <a href="profile.html">verify here.</a>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="heading-one">
						<h1>What is not OK?</h1>
						<p>
							If you are an advertiser and do not follow the rules, your account and any current account associated with you and and future account will be blocked.

						<ul class="disk-list">
							<li>Underage photos or photos of children in any listing.</li>
							<li>Trafficking, enslavement or anything similar.</li>
